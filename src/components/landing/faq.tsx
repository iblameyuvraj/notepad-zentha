    question: "What is Zentha-Notepad?",
    answer: "Zentha-Notepad is a lightweight encrypted notepad with rich text support. It is a zero-knowledge app, which means that we don't store any of your personal information or your password. We only encrypt text which never leaves your browser."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I recover my site if I forget my password?",
    answer: "Since this is a ZK app. There is no way for us to know which text belongs to what user. So unfortunately it is not possible to recover the notes without the password. Even if they are recovered it is not possible to decrypt them."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I backup my notes?",
    answer: "Currently you cannot backup your notes. I am working on that feature."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I share my notes?",
    answer: "As of now you will need to share both the name and password for your notepad. In future I am planning to allow users to create public notepads that can be shared without a password."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you verify the password if it is never sent to the server?",
    answer: "We use your password to encrypt your text on the client side. The encrypted text is then sent to the server. When you access your page, we retrieve the encrypted text from the server and decrypt it using your password. If the password is correct, the text is successfully decrypted; otherwise, it remains encrypted."
